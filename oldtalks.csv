2015/12/07,,,,"Bhargav Bhatt","University of Michigan","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bhattb/","Perfect rings and applications","I will describe certain surprising features of algebraic geometry that arise if one works exclusively with perfect rings of positive characteristic $p$; these features are are strongly reminiscent of derived algebraic geometry. When combined with some higher algebraic $K$-theory, this will allow us to attach ``determinants'' to certain mildly non-linear objects. Time permitting, I will explain why these determinants are useful in constructing an object of interest in arithmetic geometry: an algebraic variety in characteristic $p$ that parametrizes $\Z_p$-lattices in a finite dimensional $\Q_p$-vector space. This is joint work with Peter Scholze."
2015/11/16,,,,"David Treumann","Boston College","https://www2.bc.edu/david-treumann/materials.html","The Maslov cycle and the J-homomorphism"," Let $L$ be an exact Lagrangian submanifold of a cotangent bundle $T^*M$. If a topological obstruction vanishes, a Floer-theoretic construction of Nadler and Zaslow gives a functor from the category of local systems of $R$-modules on $L$ to the category of constructible sheaves of $R$-modules on $M$. I will discuss a variation of this construction that allows $R$ to be a ring spectrum. I hope it won't take any knowledge of symplectic geometry to follow the talk. This is joint work with Xin Jin."
2015/11/23,,,,"Ian Hambleton","McMaster University; Fields Institute","http://ms.mcmaster.ca/ian/ian.html","Group actions on spheres with rank one isotropy"," Actions of finite groups on spheres can be studied in various different geometrical settings, such as (A) smooth $G$-actions on a (closed manifold) homotopy sphere, (B) finite $G$-homotopy representations (as defined by tom Dieck), and (C) finite $G$-CW complexes homotopy equivalent to a sphere. These three settings generalize the basic models arising from unit spheres $S(V)$ in orthogonal or unitary $G$-representations. In the talk, I will discuss the group theoretic constraints imposed by assuming that the actions have rank 1 isotropy (meaning that the isotropy subgroups of $G$ do not contain $\Z/p \times \Z/p$, for any prime $p$).  Motivation for this requirement arises from the work of Adem and Smith (2001) on the existence of free action on products of spheres.

The main results are as follows: we give a complete answer in setting (C), where we prove that a necessary and sufficient group theoretic condition is that certain extensions, called $QD(p)$, of $SL(2,p)$ by $\Z/p \times \Z/p$ are not involved in $G$. In setting (B) we encounter more group theoretic restrictions, and give a complete answer for the finite simple groups $G$ of rank 2. The arguments use chain complexes over the orbit category. This is joint work with Ergun Yalcin."
2015/11/09,,,,"Eric Peterson","Harvard","http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ecp/","Determinantal K-theory and a few applications","Chromatic homotopy theory is a divide-and-conquer program for algebraic topology, where we study an approximating sequence of what we'd first assumed to be ``easier'' categories. These categories turn out to be very strangely behaved -- and further appear to be equipped with intriguing and exciting connections to number theory. To give an appreciation for the subject, I'll describe the most basic of these strange behaviors, then I'll describe an ongoing project which addresses a small part of the ``chromatic splitting conjecture''."
2015/11/02,,,,"Kirsten Wickelgren","Georgia Tech","http://people.math.gatech.edu/~kwickelgren3/","The $\A^1$-Milnor number: counting zeros arithmetically","A celebrated result of Eisenbud--Kimshaishvili--Levine computes the local degree of a smooth function $f : \R^n \to \R^n$ with an isolated zero at the origin. Given a polynomial function with an isolated zero at the origin, we prove that the local  $\A^1$-Brouwer degree equals the degree quadratic form of Eisenbud--Khimshiashvili--Levine, answering a question posed by David Eisenbud in 1978. This talk will present this result and then discuss applications to the study of singularities if time permits. This is joint work with Jesse Kass."
2015/10/26,,,,"Marc Hoyois","MIT","http://math.mit.edu/~hoyois/","Secondary K-theory and the categorified Chern character","The secondary $K$-theory of a derived stack $X$ is the $K$-theory of 2-vector bundles on $X$, also known as smooth proper $k$-linear dg-categories when $X = \mathrm{Spec}(k)$. It receives nontrivial maps from several interesting invariants: the Brauer spectrum of $X$, the iterated $K$-theory $K(K(X))$, and the Grothendieck ring of varieties (if $X$ is a field of characteristic zero). ToÃ«n and Vezzosi have constructed a character map associating to every 2-vector bundle a torus-invariant function on the double free loop space of $X$. I will explain how to refine their construction to obtain a secondary Chern character on secondary $K$-theory. This involves a localization theorem for traces in symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-categories and a categorified version of the ordinary Chern character, which is a functor from noncommutative mixed motives over $X$ (in the sense of Kontsevich) to $S^1$-equivariant perfect complexes on $LX$. This is joint work with Sarah Scherotzke and Nicol\`o Sibilla."
2015/10/19,,,,"John Terilla","CUNY","http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~jterilla/","Homotopy probability theory with an application to fluids","Homotopy probability theory is a version of probability theory in which the vector space of random variables is replaced with a chain complex.  I'll discuss how to use homotopy algebra (rather than analysis) to extract meaningful expectations and correlations among random variables.  I'll give some natural examples, including an example that extends ordinary probability theory on a finite volume Riemannian manifold and has applications to fluid flow."
2015/10/05,,,,"Cary Malkiewich","UIUC","http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/","Duality in topological Hochschild homology (THH)","Topological Hochschild homology ($THH$) is a beautiful and computable invariant of rings and ring spectra. In this talk, I will focus on the ring spectrum $DX$, and discuss a few different aspects of $THH(DX)$. For example, it splits when $X$ is a suspension, and we can use this for computations in topological cyclic homology. I will also recall the ``Atiyah duality'' between $THH(DX)$ and the free loop space $LX$, and prove that this duality preserves the genuine $S^1$-structure. This uses the new ``norm'' model of $THH$, and a surprising technical result about orthogonal $G$-spectra. If there is time, I will apply these tools once more and describe an enrichment of the character map from representation theory."
2015/09/28,,,,"Sune Reeh","MIT","http://math.mit.edu/~reeh/Sune_Precht_Reeh.html","Saturated fusion systems as stable retracts of groups","A saturated fusion system associated to a finite group $G$ encodes the $p$-structure of the group as the Sylow $p$-subgroup enriched with additional conjugation. The fusion system contains just the right amount of algebraic information to for instance reconstruct the $p$-completion of $BG$, but not $BG$ itself. Abstract saturated fusion systems $F$ without ambient groups exist, and these have ($p$-completed) classifying spaces $BF$ as well. In spectra, the suspension spectrum of $BF$ becomes a retract of the suspension spectrum of $BS$, for the Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$, so $BF$ gets encoded as a characteristic idempotent in the double Burnside ring of $S$. This way of looking as fusion systems as stable retracts of their Sylow $p$-subgroups is a very useful tool for generalizing theorems from groups or $p$-groups to saturated fusion systems.  In joint work with Tomer Schlank and Nat Stapleton, we use this retract approach to do Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory for all saturated fusion systems by building on the theorems for finite $p$-groups."
2015/09/21,,,,"Rob Thompson","CUNY","http://math.hunter.cuny.edu/thompson/","An unstable change of rings for Morava $E$-theory","The Bousfield-Kan (or unstable Adams) spectral sequence can be constructed for various homology theories such as Brown-Peterson homology $BP$, Johnson-Wilson theory $E(n)$ or Morava $E$-theory $E_n$. For nice spaces the $E_2$-term is given by $\mathrm{Ext}$ in a category of unstable comodules. We establish an unstable Morava change of rings isomorphism between $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{U}_{BP_*BP}}(BP_*,M)$ and $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{U}_{{E_n}_*E_n}}({E_n}_*,{E_n}_*\otimes_{BP_*}M)$ for unstable $BP_*BP$-comodules that are $v_n$-local and satisfy $I_nM=0$. We show that the latter can be interpreted as Ext in the category of comodules over a certain bialgebra. This has implications for the convergence of the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence."
2015/09/14,,,,"Martin Gallauer Alves de Souza","UCLA","http://user.math.uzh.ch/gallauer/","Traces and homotopy colimits","J.P. May proved that traces in stable monoidal homotopy categories are additive in cofiber sequences. It is then natural to ask about the interaction of traces and homotopy colimits in general. In this talk we will give an answer for homotopy colimits indexed over EI-categories. The proof involves generalizing the notion of trace from the realm of categories to derivators. It will be sketched if time permits."
2010/02/08,,,,"Simona Paoli","Penn State Altoona",,"Homotopical properties of a weakly globular model of homotopy types","Homotopy $n$-types are an important class of topological spaces: they amount to CW complexes whose homotopy groups vanish in dimension higher than $n$. The problem of modeling homotopy types is relevant both in higher category theory and homotopy theory and received contributions from both areas. There is a particularly simple model of homotopy types in the path connected case, consisting of n-fold categories internal to groups, also called $cat^n$-groups. This model, however, has the disadvantage that is it does not have an algebraic description of the Postnikov decomposition nor it is easy to establish algebraically when a map of $cat^n$-groups is a weak equivalence.  

In this talk we introduce a new model of connected $n$-types through a subcategory of $cat^n$-groups, which we call weakly globular, for which the above issues are resolved in transparent way. We also describe other homotopical properties of this model, and discuss the relevance of these structures for higher category theory. "
2010/03/01,,,,"Mark Behrens","MIT",,"The homotopy groups of the $E(2)$-local sphere, revisited","Shimomura and Yabe computed the homotopy groups of the $E(2)$-local sphere at primes greater than or equal to $5$.  However, their computation is difficult to understand.  I will describe a conceptual way to understand the answer, and the computation.  The goal is to make the answer as concrete as the image of the $J$ homomorphism.  We'll see of this goal is achieved..."
2010/03/08,,,,"Andrew Salch","Johns Hopkins University",,"$v_2$ and $v_4$","We discuss some new methods for computing the cohomology of Morava stabilizer groups at large heights. We apply these methods to compute a good approximation to the cohomology of the 5-primary height 4 stabilizer group, giving us some interesting information about $v_4$-periodic stable homotopy groups of spheres, and we discuss what is involved in computing the entire cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group for heights 4 and up."
2010/03/15,,,,"Rob Thompson","CUNY",,"$v_n$-periodic $\Pi$ algebras","A $\Pi$-algebra is a sequence of groups, along with an action of the primary homotopy operations, which are indexed by homotopy groups of wedges of spheres.  It is natural to view the homotopy groups of a space as an object in the category of $\Pi$-algebras.  The $v_n$-periodic homotopy groups of a space are obtained by inverting non-nilpotent self maps of finite complexes.  In this talk I will investigate $v_n$-periodic $\Pi$-algebras."
2010/03/29,,,,"GonÃ§alo Tabuada","Universidade Nova de Lisboa",,"Non-commutative motives","In this talk I will describe the construction of the category of non-commutative motives $[1,2,3]$ in Drinfeld-Kontsevich's non-commutative algebraic geometry program. In the process, I will present the first conceptual characterization of Quillen's higher K-theory since Quillen's foundational work in the 70's. As an application, I will show how these results allow us to obtain for free the higher Chern character from K-theory to cyclic homology.

In this talk I detail a ``theory of fusion systems with many objects,'' generalizing fusion system theory to imitate actions of a finite group on a finite set. This generalization will come in three stages:  as a simple condition to be put on a finite $p$-group-set, as algebraic structure added to the fusion system, and finally as an additional layer of structure necessary to construct classifying spaces and do homotopy theory."

2010/04/13,,,,"AngÃ©lica Osorno","MIT",,"An Infinite Loop Space Structure for $K$-theory of Bimonoidal Categories","In recent work of Baas-Dundas-Richter-Rognes, the authors introduce the notion of the $K$-theory of a bimonoidal category $R$, and show that it is equivalent to the algebraic $K$-theory space of the ring spectrum $HR$. In this thesis we show that $K(R)$ is the group completion of the classifying space of the 2-category $Mod_R$ of modules over $R$, and show that $Mod_R$ is a symmetric monoidal 2-category. We explain how to use this symmetric monoidal structure to produce a $\Gamma$-(2-category), which gives an infinite loop space structure on $K(R)$. We show that the equivalence mentioned above is an equivalence of infinite loop spaces."
2010/04/26,,,,"Martin Frankland","MIT",,"Quillen cohomology of $\Pi$-algebras and application to their realization","A $\Pi$-algebra is a graded group with additional structure that makes it look like the homotopy groups of a space. Given one such object $A$, one may ask if it can be realized topologically: Is there a space $X$ such that $\pi_*X$ is isomorphic to $A$ as a $\Pi$-algebra, and if so, can we classify them?

Work of Blanc-Dwyer-Goerss provided an obstruction theory to realizing a $\Pi$-algebra $A$, where the obstructions (to existence and uniqueness) live in certain Quillen cohomology groups of $A$. What do these groups look like, and can we compute them?

We will tackle this question from the algebraic side, focusing on Quillen cohomology of truncated $\Pi$-algebras. We will then use the obstruction theory to obtain results on the classification of certain 2-stage homotopy types, and compare them to what is known from other approaches."

It can perform basic operations like joins, products, and connected sums. It can compute homology and cohomology over the integers or over a field. In this talk, we will discuss and demonstrate some of these capabilities, present some related unsolved problems, and discuss future directions."
2010/09/13,,,,"Thomas Kragh","University of Oslo; MIT",,"Nearby Lagrangians ","The first part of this talk is basic definitions and 
statement of the Nearby Lagrangian Conjecture (NLC).  I will then go on 
describing previous results relating to my talk especially that of Viterbo 
in 1998 and that of Fukaya, Seidel and Smith in 2007 (refined this year by 
Abouzaid to a very strong result in the case of vanishing Maslov class).  
I will then describe an approach using fibered spectra which partly 
unifies the two rather different approaches and then state new results in 
the general case (non-vanishing Maslov class) following from a product 
structure on a fibered spectrum combined with the intersection product on 
the base manifold (probably relatable to the pair of pants product and a 
twisted version of the Chas-Sullivan product)."

informatics,'' which is the study of information and communication from a 
category-theoretic perspective.  In order to begin such a study, one must 
ground it in something concrete.  To that end, I'll explain a simple 
categorical model of databases, which are real-world store-houses of 
organized information.

I will then discuss information transfer between databases and move on to 
define a more general notion of communication networks.  Briefly, a 
communication network is a simplicial complex (of interacting groups) 
equipped with a sheaf of databases (common languages) on its simplices.  I 
will show how this same structure can be pared down to give a categorical 
model for combining information obtained from various sources.  I'll end 
by showing some interesting consequences of the topological nature of this 
model."

on recent work, joint with Christopher Douglas and Noah Snyder, on 
understanding the nature of fully extended (a.k.a. local) 3-dimensional 
topological quantum field theories.  Specifically, we show that fusion 
categories are fully-dualizable objects in the 3-category of tensor 
categories, a natural categorification of the bicategory of algebras, 
bimodules, and bimodule maps.  Fusion categories themselves are well-known 
are arise in several areas of mathematics and physics -- conformal field 
theory, operator algebras, representation theory of quantum groups, and 
others.  In light of Hopkins and Lurie's work on the cobordism hypothesis, 
this provides a fully local TQFT for arbitrary fusion categories.  
Moreover, we will discuss how many familiar structures from the theory of 
fusion categories are given a natural explanation from this point of 
view."

algebroids) play an increasingly important role in foliation theory, 
symplectic and Poisson geometry, and non-commutative geometry.  In this 
lecture, I will explain how some basic properties of Lie groups extend to 
groupoids, and how some other properties don't."
2010/10/18,,,,"Kyle Ormsby","MIT",,"Equivariant motivic homotopy and the completion problem for Hermitian K-theory","I will discuss the 
(motivic, or $A^1$) homotopy theory of $G$-equivariant schemes, 
$G$ a finite group.  Stabilizing with respect to regular representation of 
spheres produces a good stable theory which, in the case $G=Z/2$, 
contains motivic analogues of Atiyah's Real K-theory and Araki's Real 
cobordism over arbitrary characteristic $0$ base fields.  The algebraic 
Real $K$-theory spectrum is closely related to Hermitian $K$-theory 
(a.k.a. higher Grothendieck-Witt theory).  Tools from stable equivariant 
topology like the Tate diagram and slice spectral sequence allow us to 
resolve the completion (or homotopy limit) problem for the Hermitian 
$K$-theory of fields."
2010/11/01,,,,"Kate Ponto","Kentucky",,"Fixed points and traces","The Lefschetz fixed point theorem gives a sufficient 
condition for a continuous endomorphism to have a fixed point: If the 
Lefschetz number of a continuous endomorphism of a closed smooth manifold 
is nonzero, that endomorphism has a fixed point.  Usually no conclusions 
can be drawn if the Lefschetz number is zero, but with some (restrictive) 
hypotheses, there is a converse.  I will describe an approach to the 
converse of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem using traces that also gives 
converses to the equivariant and fiverwise Lefschetz fixed point 
theorems."

$R$: for a smooth curve $X$ over $R$ with negative Euler 
characteristic, $\pi_0(X(R))$ is determined by the maximal 
2-nilpotent quotient of the fundamental group with its Galois action, as 
the kernel of an obstruction of Jordan Ellenberg.  This implies that the 
set of real points equipped with a real tangent direction of the smooth 
compactification of $X$ is determined by the maximal 2-nilpotent quotient 
of $Gal(C(X))$ with its 
$Gal(R)$ action, showing a 2-nilpotent birational 
real section conjecture."
2010/11/15,,,,"Srinikanth Iyengar","Nebraska",,"Colocalizing subcategories of the stable module category of (possibly infinite dimensional) modules over a finite group","I will describe recent work 
with Dave Benson and Henning Krause wherein we classify colocalizing 
subcategories of StMod(kG), for a finite group G, in the spirit of earlier 
work by Hopkins, Neeman, and Benson, Carlson, and Rickard on thick 
subcategories and localizing subcategories in various contexts.  A central 
result in our work is a criteria for the vanishing of a function object, 
$Hom_k(M,N)$, in StMod(kG), in terms of geometric data (to be precise: 
support and cosupport) associated to M and N, via local cohomology and 
completion functors on the stable module category."
2010/11/22,,,,"David Ayala","Harvard",,"A combinatorial $E_n$ operad","I will propose a simple and combinatorial 
$E_n$-operad which is built out of finite posets indexing a stratification 
of configuration spaces of points in an $n$-disk.  This poset is 
constructed from a category $\theta_n$ which has recently become an 
important player for modeling weak $n$-categories (Joyal, Berger, Rezk).  
The techniques involved use the formalism of quasi-categories (Lurie).  This project is joint with Richard Hepworth (Copenhagen) and is a work in progress.

One (nearly achieved) goal is to directly and geometrically relate three 
well-developed methods for recognizing $n$-fold loop spaces: as certain 
algebras over the little $n$-disk operad, as certain algebras over the 
Barratt-Eccles $E_n$ operad (via the Smith filtration), and as certain 
presheaves on $\theta_n$ (Berger).  A version of Dunn's additivity theorem 
becomes a formal consequence of the setup.  A farther away goal is to 
imitate the construction of topological chiral homology using this proposed $E_n$-operad.  This should have the benefit of making topological chiral homology (and possibly other field theories) more prepared for computations."

and Taubes considered a bundle over the space of knots whose fiber is a 
compactified configuration space, and they constructed knot invariants by 
performing integration along the fiber of this bundle.  Their method was 
subsequently used to construct real cohomology classes in spaces of knots 
in $R^n$, $n>3$.  Replacing integration of differential forms by a 
Pontrjagin-Thom construction, I have constructed cohomology classes with 
arbitrary coefficients.  Motivated by work of Budney and F. Cohen on the 
homology of the space of long knots in $R^3$, I have also proven a 
product formula for these classes with respect to connect-sum.  If time 
permits, I will mention some progress towards further understanding these 
classes using a cosimplicial model for knot spaces coming from the 
Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus."

Cortinas, Christian Hassemeyer and Chuck Weibel.  Let $A$ be a commutative 
monoid and $k$ a field.  What part of the algebraic K-theory of the

field $k$?  I describe a partial answer to this question, one which 
involves topological cyclic homology, toric varieties, and Voevodsky's cdh 
topology.  I will also explain how our answer leads to a proof of 
Gubeladze's ``nilpotence'' conjecture for the algebraic K-theory of toric

We describe this category in terms of the action of infinitesimal Hecke functors on the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $Bun_G$.  This family of functors, parametrized by the Ran space of $X$, act by averaging a quasi-coherent sheaf over infinitesimal modifications of $G$-bundles at prescribed points of $X$.  We show that sheaves which are, in a certain sense, equivariant with respect to infinitesimal Hecke functors are exactly $D$-modules, i.e. quasi-coherent sheaves with a flat connection.

Classically, the topology of a closed $X$ can be described in terms of the spaces of v-trajectories that link the singular points of $f$. On manifolds with boundary, the situation is somewhat different: there, a massive set of nonsingular functions is available. For such Morse data $(f, v)$, the interactions of the gradient flow with the boundary dX take central stage. We will introduce and measure the convexity and concavity of a $v$-flow relative to $dX$. ``Some manifolds are intrinsically more concave than others with respect to any gradient flow'' is the main slogan of the talk. Stated differently, the intrinsic concavity of $X$ is a reflection of its complexity. We will explain how this approach leads to new topological invariants, both of the flow $v$ and of the manifold $X$. In 3D, we have a good grasp of these invariants and their connection to the classification of 3-folds."

When $p$ is inverted, choice of level-$p$-structure for an elliptic curve provides a geometrically well-behaved cover of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{ell}}$, which allows one to consider tmf as the homotopy fixed points of tmf($p$), topological modular forms with level-$p$-structure, under a natural action by $\text{GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/p)$.

In this talk I will discuss the equivariant stable homotopy types, for finite groups, obtained from this filtration for the infinite symmetric product of representation spheres. The filtration is more complicated than in the non-equivariant case, and already on the zeroth homotopy groups an interesting filtration of the augmentation ideal of the Burnside ring functor arises.

Taking as our lead the theory of the ``walking adjunction'' A of 2-category
theory, we generalise to categories enriched in quasicategories and show that
this same 2-category plays a similar role in this new context. Specifically,
using insights drawn from the calculus of string diagrams we give an explicit
presentation of A as a simplicially enriched category. We then use this to show
that if C is any quasicategory enriched category and u is a right adjont 0-arrow
in C, in some suitable sense to be discussed, then this data may be completed to
give a simplicially enriched functor A->C. Furthermore, we show that the space
of all such exensions is contractible.

That adjunctions of quasicategories may be completed up to enriched functors on
A in this way contains, in its very essence, the adjunction data discussed by
Jacob Lurie. Such enriched functors encapsulate both the coherent monad and the
coherent comonad generated by such an adjunction and provide the building blocks
upon which to found a formal theory of such things along the lines established
by Street in the 2-categorical context."

must also be the same.  Further work in the 60s and 70s generalized
this to other geometries by constructing groups which encode scissors
congruence data.  Though most of the computational techniques used
with these groups related to group homology, the algebraic K-theory of
various fields appears in some very unexpected places in the

Informally, if the $k$-dilation of a map is less than a small $\epsilon$, it means that the map strongly shrinks each $k$-dimensional surface. Our main question is: can a map with very small $k$-dilation still be homotopically non-trivial? Here are the main results. If $k > (m+1)/2$, then there are homotopically non-trivial maps from $S^m$ to $S^{m-1}$ with arbitrarily small $k$-dilation. But if $k \leq (m + 1)/2$, then every homotopically non-trivial map from $S^m$ to $S^{m - 1}$ has $k$-dilation at least $c(m) > 0$. "

On the other hand, $S$ acts on $G$ by left and right multiplication.  The resulting $(S,S)$-biset $_SG_S$ turns out to contain much of the same information as $\mathcal{F_S(G)}$, in that the biset determines the fusion system, but not conversely. These notions can be abstracted to make no reference to the ambient group $G$, resulting in an \emph{abstract saturated fusion system} $\mathcal{F}$ on $S$ and a \emph{characteristic biset} $\Omega$ for $\mathcal{F}$.  Again, $\Omega$ determines $\mathcal{F}$, but each $\mathcal{F}$ has many associated characteristic bisets. This talk will focus on the failure of a saturated fusion system to uniquely determine a characteristic biset.

2013/02/11,,,,"Michael Ching","Amherst College",,"Some examples of homotopic descent","I will describe a collection of theorems that exemplify homotopic descent. Each of these theorems says that a certain Quillen adjunction is `comonadic' in a homotopical sense: that is, it identifies the homotopy theory on one side of the adjunction with the homotopy theory of coalgebras over a certain comonad that acts on the other side. I will say what I mean by the homotopy theory of such coalgebras and give a Barr-Beck comonadicity condition.

The examples concern operad theory and Goodwillie calculus. One result identifies the homotopy theory of 0-connected algebras over an operad of spectra with that of 0-connected divided power coalgebras over the Koszul dual operad. (This is joint work with John Harper.) Another describes the homotopy theory of n-excisive homotopy functors (between categories of spaces and/or spectra) in terms of appropriate comonads. (This is joint work with Greg Arone.) In the case of functors from spaces to spectra, and algebras over the commutative operad, there is a close connection between these two examples, which I shall describe."
2013/02/25,,,,"Matthew Gelvin","University of Copenhagen",,"Parametrization of characteristic bisets of a saturated fusion system","For $G$ a finite group with Sylow subgroup $S$, the conjugation action of $G$ on the subgroups of $S$ gives rise to the data of a \emph{saturated fusion system} $\mathcal{F_S(G)}$ on $S$.  On the other hand, $S$ acts on $G$ by left and right multiplication.  The resulting $(S,S)$-biset $_SG_S$ turns out to contain much of the same information as $\mathcal{F_S(G)}$, in that the biset determines the fusion system, but not conversely.

These notions can be abstracted to make no reference to the ambient group $G$, resulting in an \emph{abstract saturated fusion system} $\mathcal{F}$ on $S$ and a \emph{characteristic biset} $\Omega$ for $\mathcal{F}$.  Again, $\Omega$ determines $\mathcal{F}$, but each $\mathcal{F}$ has many associated characteristic bisets.  

This talk will focus on the failure of a saturated fusion system to uniquely determine a characteristic biset.  We will show that there is a parametrization of all characteristic bisets for a fixed $\mathcal{F}$, which will have as a consequence the surprising result that each saturated fusion system has a unique \emph{minimal} associated characteristic biset."

mean the spectrum is provided with a pairing which has a two-sided unit 
but is not necessarily homotopy commutative or homotopy associative. 
If in addition, the spectrum is homotopy associative and homotopy 
commutative, one can sometimes say more.

Twenty five years ago I proved that if $X$ is a finite ring spectrum of

the self-map $f^i$ is a ring spectrum for any $i$, and the pairing on $X(f^i)$
extends the pairing on $X$.  In this talk, I will discuss my recent result

The objects in this topological category are symplectic manifolds, and the space of morphisms is an infinite loop space obtained by stabilizing the space of immersed totally-real correspondences between the source and target. A variant of this category can be traced back almost 30 years to early work of A. Weinstein on geometric quantization. In my talk, I will motivate the definition of the Stable Symplectic category. This will lead us to the construction of a canonical fiber functor F, on this category with values in the monoidal category of modules over a commutative ring spectrum Omega. The main aim of my talk is to explore the Motivic Galois group Aut(F) (i.e. the group of monoidal automorphisms of F). This group will be shown to be the abelian quotient of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group as described by Kontsevich. Extending this observation along the lines of homotopy theory, we will motivate the topological hochschild homology of Omega:THH(Omega), as an integral candidate for Aut(F). If time permits, I would like to formulate some natural geometric questions in symplectic topology in terms of THH(Omega) and the Waldhausen K-theory K(Omega).

bundles but with locally twisted transition functions.  If we instead
consider twisted vector bundles with a symmetry encoded by the action
of a compact Lie group, the resulting theory is equivariant twisted
K-theory.  This subject has garnered much attention for its
connections to conformal field theory and representations of loop
groups.  While twisted K-theory can be defined entirely in terms of
the geometry of vector bundles, there is a homotopy-theoretic
formulation using the language of parametrized spectra.  In fact, from
this point of view we can define twists of any multiplicative
generalized cohomology theory, not just K-theory.  The aim of this
talk is to explain how this works, and then to propose a definition of
equivariant twisted cohomology theories using a similar framework.
The main ingredient is a structured approach to multiplicative
homotopy theory that allows for the notion of a G-torsor where G is a

I will then describe a geometric construction of the homomorphisms objects in these categories of modules inspired by factorization homology (also called chiral homology). A particular case of this construction is higher Hochschild cohomology (i.e. Hochschild cohomology for Ed-algebras).

Its first part will deal with generalizing many of the original results of Goodwillie so that
they apply to a larger class of model categories and hence be applicable to $Alg_{\mathcal{O}}$.
The second part will apply that generalized theory to the $Alg_{\mathcal{O}}$ categories. The
main results here are: an understanding of finitary homogeneous functors between such categories;
identifying the Taylor tower of the identity in those categories; showing that
finitary n-excisive functors can not distinguish between $Alg_{\mathcal{O}}$ and $Alg_{\mathcal{O_{\leq n}}}$, the category

In this talk I will introduce a general theory of such weak or
homotopy-coherent enrichment, built using a non-symmetric variant of
Lurie's infinity-operads. I will then describe how the correct homotopy
theory of these enriched infinity-categories can be constructed as a

In this talk, we briefly explain what derived manifolds ought to be, why one should care about them, and how one can describe them.

For every stability condition $\sigma$, one can obtain a filtration on the algebraic $K$-theory of $\mathcal{C}$. These filtrations vary on the complex manifold only along real codimension $1$ ``walls'' inside the complex manifold, and there should be a ``wall-crossing formula'' relating the $E_2$ pages of the spectral sequence associated to a filtration. I started looking into this because I wanted to encode Hall-algebra-like structures on the Ran space of the circle, so I will discuss that as motivation first."

This and similar techniques allow to show the norm map from homotopy orbits to homotopy fixed points to be an equivalence in many cases (like the $GL_2(Z/n)$-action on Tmf$(n)$).

Should $M$ be a circle, this recovers the Hochschild complex of $A$; should $A$ be an abelian group, this recovers the homology of $M$ with coefficients in $A$.  In general, factorization homology retains more information about a manifold than its underlying homotopy type, and can be interpreted as the global observables of a perturbative TQFT.
In this talk we will lift PoincarÃ© duality to factorization homology as it intertwines with Koszul duality for $n$-disk algebras -- all terms will be explained.  We will point out a number of consequences of this duality, which concern manifold invariants, algebra invariants, and TQFT's.\\

This translates to a canonical presentation of any diagram or natural transformation as a (relative) cell complex and as a (relative) Postnikov tower whose cells are built from the latching or matching maps. This work, joint with Dominic Verity, makes the proof of the Reedy model structure essentially trivial and leads to a geometric criterion characterizing the Reedy categories which give formulae for homotopy (co)limits. Work in progress extends these results to generalized Reedy

Marc Levine has recently proven that when $k$ is algebraically closed of characteristic $0$, (the left derived functor of) $c$ is full and faithful on homotopy categories.  I will show that when $k$ is real closed, $F_{k[i]/k}$ induces a full and faithful embedding of the $C_2$-equivariant stable homotopy category into the stable motivic homotopy category of $k$.  In particular, there is an isomorphism between the integer-graded stable homotopy groups of the $C_2$-equivariant sphere spectrum and the motivic sphere spectrum over $k$."

For example the category of endofunctors of G-spaces with this property does not model G-spectra. One solution is to replace squares by 'cubes with action', where the group is allowed to act on the whole diagram by permuting its vertices. 

I will talk about the homotopy theory of these equivariant diagrams and relate the resulting notion of equivariant excision to previous work of Blumberg.

The proof uses the surprising fact, proved by Schlichting, that, on the set of components of the subspace of the left-hand side consisting of the points fixed by the canonical involution, the abelian monoid structure induced by orthogonal sum is an abelian group structure.

In the case when the manifold $M=S_g$ is a surface, the Madsen-Weiss theorem together with Harer stability imply that as $g$ grows, a large number of these classes become *non-zero*. On the other hand, relationship between BDiff $S_g$ and the  moduli space of Riemann surfaces (which has finite dimension) implies that a large number of these classes *are* zero.

Recently, Galatius and Randall-Williams proved an analogue of the Madsen-Weiss theorem and of Harer stability for the case when $M$ is a connected sum of products of spheres $S^d \times S^d$.

One interesting application of this structure consists in finding another way to compute extension groups ${\rm Ext}^i_R(M,N)$ for every pair of left $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, by using certain cofibrant and fibrant replacements of the sphere chain complexes $S^0(M)$ and $S^i(N)$, respectively. Recall that one normally computes ${\rm Ext}^i_R(M,N)$ by using either a left resolution of $M$ by projective modules or a right resolution of $N$ by injective modules. Somewhat surprisingly, there turn out to be many other ways to do it. We prove that one can use a left resolution of $M$ by modules of projective dimension at most $n$. The disadvantage of doing so is that  we use right resolutions of $N$ by a class of modules which is hard to describe.

In this context, there is a notion of ``intersection-formality'', measuring the vanishing of Massey products in intersection cohomology. The perverse homotopy type of a complex projective variety with isolated singularities can be computed from the morphism of differential graded algebras induced by the inclusion of the link of the singularity into the regular part of the variety. I will show how, in this case, mixed Hodge theory allows us prove some intersection-formality results (work in progress with David Chataur)."

In the motivic Adams spectral sequence computing the motivic stable homotopy groups, there result a number of $h_1$-towers. The motivic Adams spectral sequence contains strictly more information than the classical case and is therefore quite complicated, but the $h_1$-local part is understood and computes the $\eta$-localization of the motivic sphere.

There is a unital multiplication on field theories, and so naturally a subset which are invertible.  Invertible topological field theories can be realized as infinite loop maps in stable homotopy theory, and the Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem identifies the domain.  After exposing these ideas, I will indicate two applications.  In the first, joint with Hopkins and Teleman, an invertible topological field theory is the obstruction to consistently orienting moduli spaces.

In joint work with Oliver Braunling and Michael Groechenig, we construct an analogous index map in algebraic K-theory. The index map allows us to relate the Contou-Carrere symbol, a local analytic invariant of families of schemes, to algebraic K-theory. Using this, we prove reciprocity laws for Contou-Carrere symbols in all dimensions.  This extends previous results, of Anderson and Pablos Romo in dimension 1, and of Osipov and Zhu, in dimension 2.

Instead of having G act on S, we can consider G as an (S,S)-biset and ask what properties it has in relation to the fusion system. The resulting notion of characteristic bisets makes sense for abstract fusion systems as well, and such characteristic bisets were originally used by Broto-Levi-Oliver to define a classifying spectrum for every saturated fusion system. In joint work with Matthew Gelvin we give a classification of all characteristic bisets for a given saturated fusion system F and show that there is a unique minimal one $\lambda_F$ contained in all others. We describe the structure of $\lambda_F$ and the close relation between $\lambda_F$ and other important concepts in the theory of fusion systems, such as for instance the linking system used to construct the classifying space of F."

Equivariant infinite loop space theory allows us to define spectrum level generalizations of the early definitions: we can encode a G-action (not necessarily trivial) on the input as a genuine G-spectrum. I will discuss some of the subtleties involved in turning a ring or category with G-action into the right input for equivariant algebraic K-theory, and some of the properties of the resulting equivariant algebraic K-theory G-spectrum.

2015/02/17,,,,"John Harper","Ohio State",,"Derived Koszul duality and TQ-homology completion","Consider a flavor of structured ring spectra that can be described as algebras over an operad $O$ in spectra. A natural question to ask is when the fundamental adjunction comparing $O$-algebra spectra with coalgebra spectra over the associated Koszul dual comonad $K$ can be modified to turn it into an equivalence of homotopy theories. In a paper published in 2012, Francis and Gaitsgory conjecture that replacing $O$-algebras with the full subcategory of homotopy pro-nilpotent $O$-algebras will do the trick. In joint work with Kathryn Hess we show that every 0-connected $O$-algebra is homotopy pro-nilpotent; i.e. is the homotopy limit of a tower of nilpotent $O$-algebras.

This talk will describe recent work, joint with Michael Ching, that resolves in the affirmative the 0-connected case of the Francis-Gaitsgory conjecture; that replacing $O$-algebras with 0-connected $O$-algebras turns the fundamental adjunction into an equivalence of homotopy theories. This can be thought of as a spectral algebra analog of the fundamental work of Quillen and Sullivan on the
rational homotopy theory of spaces, the subsequent work of Goerss and Mandell on the p-adic homotopy theory of spaces, and the work of
Mandell on integral cochains and homotopy type. Corollaries include the following: (i) 0-connected $O$-algebra spectra are weakly equivalent

In this talk, I'll discuss the notion of an $N_\infty$ operad, an operad in $G$-space which just like the $E_\infty$ operad parameterizes multiplications commutative up to all higher homotopies but which also allows $G$ to permute factors.

In this talk, we will show that (under mild conditions) the fiber term is compactly generated by a Koszul-type spectrum formed from $R$ and $S$, which when $R= BP \langle n \rangle$ and $S = \{v_n \}$ differs from $BP \langle n-1 \rangle = R/v_n$. We will then apply trace methods to show that their $K$-theories differ, answering a question of Rognes.

2015/04/13,,,,"Michael Andrews","MIT",,"The $v_1$-periodic part of the Adams spectral sequence at an odd prime - dancers to a discordant system","Algebraic topologists are interested in the class of spaces which can be built from spheres. For this reason, when one tries to understand the continuous maps between two spaces up to homotopy, it is natural to restrict attention to the maps between spheres first. The groups of interest are called the homotopy groups of spheres. Topologists soon realized that it is easier to work in a stable setting. Instead, one asks about the stable homotopy groups of spheres or, equivalently, the homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum. Calculating all of these groups is an impossible task but one can ask for partial information.

In particular, one can try to understand the global structure of these groups by proving the existence of recurring patterns; this is analogous to the fact that we cannot find all the prime numbers, but we can prove theorems about their distribution. These patterns are clearly visible in spectral sequence charts for calculating $\pi_*(S^0)$ and my thesis came about because of my desire to understand the mystery behind these powerful dots and lines, which others in the field appeared so in awe of. I will tell the story of the stable homotopy groups of spheres for odd primes at chromatic height 1, through the lens of the Adams spectral sequence."

Using the self maps provided by the Hopkins-Smith periodicity theorem, we can decompose the unstable homotopy groups of a space into its periodic parts, except some lower stems. For fixed n, using the Bousfield-Kuhn functor we can associate to any space a spectrum, which captures the $v_n$-periodic part of its homotopy groups.

I will talk about the homotopy type of the Bousfield-Kuhn functor applied to spheres, which would tell us much about the $v_n$-periodic part of the homotopy groups of spheres provided we have a good understanding of the telescope conjecture. I will make use of the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor, which resolves the unstable spheres into spectra which are the Steinberg summands of the classifying spaces of the additive groups of vector spaces over finite fields.

By understanding the attaching maps of the Goodwillie tower after applying the Bousfield-Kuhn functor, we would be able to determine the homotopy type of its effect on spheres. As an example of how this works in concrete computations, I will compute the K(2)-local homotopy groups of the three sphere at primes p>3.

The computations show that the unstable homotopy groups not only have finite p-torsion, their K(2)-local parts also have finite $v_1$-torsion, which indicates there might be a more general finite $v_n$-torsion phenomena in the unstable world, conjectured by many people."

In this talk, I will explain why this description cannot hold at the prime $p=2$. More precisely, let $V(0)$ be the mod $2$ Moore spectrum. I will give a summary of how one uses the duality resolution techniques to show that $\pi_{k}L_1L_{K(2)}V(0)$ is not zero when $k$ is congruent to $5$ modulo $8$.

In this talk, we will show the equivalence of these two descriptions for complex p-adic K-Theory.

By Thom's transversality theorem, one can deform $A$ to be transverse to $B$ and take the intersection: the result, written $A\cap B$, will be a smooth manifold. Moreover, if $A$ and $B$ are compact, then there is a cup product formula in cobordism, integral cohomology, etc. of the form $[A]\cup[B]=[AB]$, where $[\cdot]$ denotes the cohomology fundamental class.  The problem is that $AB$ is not unique, and there is no functorial way to choose transverse intersections for pairs of submanifolds. The goal of the theory of derived manifolds is to correct this defect.  The category of derived manifolds contains the category of manifolds as a full subcategory, is closed under taking intersections of manifolds, and yet has enough structure that every compact derived manifold has a fundamental class. Even if the submanifolds $A$ and $B$ of $M$ are not transverse (in which case their intersection can be arbitrarily singular), their intersection $A\times_MB$ will be a derived manifold with $[A\times_MB]= [AB]$, and thus satisfy the above cup product formula.  To construct the category of derived manifolds, one imitates the constructions of schemes, but in a smooth and homotopical way. I will begin the talk by explaining this construction. Then I will give some examples and discuss some features of the category of derived manifolds.

What is the fundamental group or the first homology group of the associated space in case $G$ is a finite, discrete group?

This deceptively elementary question as well as more global information given in this talk is based on joint work with A. Adem, E. Torres, and J. Gomez."

I will also introduce the category of $1$-manifolds and $2$-cobordisms endowed with flat connections. Using classical techniques of Atiyah-Bott, and more recent techniques introduced by Madsen-Weiss and coauthors, we will give a complete description of the classifying space of this category. This is joint work with R. Cohen and S. Galatius."

In a 2001 paper, Dan Dugger showed that if $C$ is combinatorial, it can be realized as a left Bousfield localization of simplicial presheaves on some small site. I'll describe a variation of this theorem: by replacing simplicial sets with a cubical model for the homotopy category, we can produce a presentation for $C$ when $C$ is symmetric monoidal that retains the monoidal structure of $C$ as the Day convolution product."

I will explain how Goodwillie's cutting method enables us to understand the homotopy type of this space of emeddings. I will then prove that the rational homology of that space is actually an invariant of the rational homotopy type of $M$. The proof is based on Kontsevich's theorem on the formality of the little cube operad and Arone's description of the layers of Weiss' orthogonal tower for the space of embeddings. This is a joint work with Greg Arone and Ismar Volic."
2009/03/02,,,,"John Harper","EPFL",,"Bar constructions and Quillen homology of modules over operads","In Haynes Miller's proof of the Sullivan conjecture on maps from classifying spaces, Quillen's derived functor notion of homology (in the case of commutative algebras) is a critical ingredient. This suggests that homology for the larger class of algebraic structures parametrized by an operad will also provide interesting and useful invariants. Working in the two contexts of symmetric spectra and unbounded chain complexes, we establish a homotopy theory for studying Quillen homology of modules and algebras over operads, and we show that this homology can be calculated using simplicial bar constructions. A key part of the argument is proving that the forgetful functor commutes with certain homotopy colimits. A larger goal is to determine the extra structure that appears on the derived homology and the extent to which the original object can be recovered from its homology when this extra structure is taken into account. This talk is an introduction to these results with an emphasis on several of the motivating ideas."

Given a map $f:X \rightarrow \mathrm{BGL}_1(R)$, we can construct a Thom spectrum $Xf$. If $f$ is a loop map, then there is an $A_\infty$ $R$ module structure on the Thom spectrum. I will consider various examples of these Thom spectra and construct $A_\infty$ structures on them. I will then use this identification to calculate Topological Hochschild Homology."

I will discuss the connectivity of a ""generalized linking number"" from the homotopy fiber of the inclusion of $\mathrm{Link}(P,Q;N)$ into $\mathrm{Map}(P,N)\times\mathrm{Map}(Q,N)$ to a certain cobordism space of manifolds over a space which is a homotopy theoretic model for the intersections of $P$ and $Q$. The proof of the connectivity uses some easy statements about connectivities in the world of smooth manifolds as a guide for obtaining similar estimates in a setting where the tools of differential topolgy do not apply. This is joint work with Tom Goodwillie."
