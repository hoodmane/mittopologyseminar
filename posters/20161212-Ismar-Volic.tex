Manifold calculus of functors has in recent years been applied with great success to various spaces of embeddings.
In this talk, I will present some new applications and situations where this theory is proving useful.  One application is to
spaces of homotopy string links where manifold calculus provides a connection to certain spaces of diagrams and trees, as well
as to classical objects like Milnor invariants.  Another application is to spaces of immersions with a finite number of
self-intersections where manifold calculus supplies a new understanding of some classical problems in combinatorial topology.
A common theme (and difficulty) in these seemingly unrelated topics is a certain subspace arrangement, and some time will be
devoted to the discussion of its structure.
