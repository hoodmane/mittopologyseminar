The aim of this talk is to discuss the homotopy coherence properties of
adjunctions between quasi-categories.

Taking as our lead the theory of the ``walking adjunction'' A of 2-category
theory, we generalise to categories enriched in quasicategories and show that
this same 2-category plays a similar role in this new context. Specifically,
using insights drawn from the calculus of string diagrams we give an explicit
presentation of A as a simplicially enriched category. We then use this to show
that if C is any quasicategory enriched category and u is a right adjont 0-arrow
in C, in some suitable sense to be discussed, then this data may be completed to
give a simplicially enriched functor A->C. Furthermore, we show that the space
of all such exensions is contractible.

That adjunctions of quasicategories may be completed up to enriched functors on
A in this way contains, in its very essence, the adjunction data discussed by
Jacob Lurie. Such enriched functors encapsulate both the coherent monad and the
coherent comonad generated by such an adjunction and provide the building blocks
upon which to found a formal theory of such things along the lines established
by Street in the 2-categorical context.
