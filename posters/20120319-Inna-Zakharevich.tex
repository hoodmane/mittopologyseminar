Hilbert's third problem asks the following question: given two
polyhedra with the same volume, is it possible to dissect one into
finitely many polyhedra and rearrange it into the other one?  The
answer (due to Dehn in 1901) is no: there is another invariant that
must also be the same.  Further work in the 60s and 70s generalized
this to other geometries by constructing groups which encode scissors
congruence data.  Though most of the computational techniques used
with these groups related to group homology, the algebraic K-theory of
various fields appears in some very unexpected places in the
computations.  We will give a different perspective on this problem by
examining it from the perspective of algebraic K-theory: we construct
the K-theory spectrum of a scissors congruence
problem and relate some of the classical structures on scissors
congruence groups to structures on this spectrum.
