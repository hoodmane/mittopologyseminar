\begin{fitbox}{0.9\textwidth}{11.5cm}
Categories enriched in symmetric monoidal categories such as spectra turn
up in various places in algebraic topology. Unfortunately these can be
difficult to work with in a homotopically meaningful way, which suggests
that for many purposes it would be better to work with less rigid
structures, where composition is only associative up to coherent homotopy.
In this talk I will introduce a general theory of such weak or
homotopy-coherent enrichment, built using a non-symmetric variant of
Lurie's infinity-operads. I will then describe how the correct homotopy
theory of these enriched infinity-categories can be constructed as a
localization of a homotopy theory defined using infinity-operads; this is
joint work with David Gepner. In addition, I will discuss some comparison
results and, time permitting, mention analogues of natural transformations
and correspondences in this setting.
