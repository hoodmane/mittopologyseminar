Bott 
and Taubes considered a bundle over the space of knots whose fiber is a 
compactified configuration space, and they constructed knot invariants by 
performing integration along the fiber of this bundle.  Their method was 
subsequently used to construct real cohomology classes in spaces of knots 
in $R^n$, $n>3$.  Replacing integration of differential forms by a 
Pontrjagin-Thom construction, I have constructed cohomology classes with 
arbitrary coefficients.  Motivated by work of Budney and F. Cohen on the 
homology of the space of long knots in $R^3$, I have also proven a 
product formula for these classes with respect to connect-sum.  If time 
permits, I will mention some progress towards further understanding these 
classes using a cosimplicial model for knot spaces coming from the 
Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus.
