Quillen's derived functor notion of homology provides
interesting and useful invariants in a variety of homotopical
contexts, and includes as special cases (i) singular homology of
spaces, (ii) homology of groups, and (iii) Andre-Quillen homology of
commutative rings. Working in the topological context of symmetric
spectra, we study topological Quillen homology of commutative ring
spectra, $E_n$ ring spectra, and more generally, algebras over any
operad $O$ in spectra. Using a QH-completion construction---analogous to
the Bousfield-Kan R-completion of spaces---we prove under appropriate
conditions (a) strong convergence of the associated homotopy spectral
sequence, and (b) that connected O-algebras are QH-complete---thus
recovering the O-algebra from its topological Quillen homology plus
extra structure. A key problem in usefully describing this extra
structure was solved recently using homotopical ideas in joint work
with Kathryn Hess that describes a rigidification of the derived
comonad that coacts on the object underlying topological Quillen
homology, and plays the analogous role (in symmetric spectra) of the
Koszul cooperad associated to a Koszul operad in chain complexes. This
talk is an introduction to these results with an emphasis on proving
(a) and (b) which is joint work with Michael Ching.
