\begin{fitbox}{0.9\textwidth}{11.5cm}
Two of the recent successes of representation stability are the description of the stable completed cohomology of arithmetic groups by Calegari-Emerton, and the proof of excision in continuous K-theory by Calegari. I'll explain these theorems, focusing on concrete cases such as H_1, K_1 and K_2 where we can work out explicitly exactly what is going on; I won't say anything fancy unless we can see it in at least one case. No knowledge of representation stability or K-theory needed; in fact, I'll give an introduction to many aspects of classical K-theory such as the congruence subgroup property and the Steinberg group.
