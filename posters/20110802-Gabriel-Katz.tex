\begin{fitbox}{0.9\textwidth}{11.5cm}
Let $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function on a manifold $X$ and $v$ its gradient-like vector field. Classically, the topology of a closed $X$ can be described in terms of the spaces of v-trajectories that link the singular points of $f$. On manifolds with boundary, the situation is somewhat different: there, a massive set of nonsingular functions is available. For such Morse data $(f, v)$, the interactions of the gradient flow with the boundary dX take central stage. We will introduce and measure the convexity and concavity of a $v$-flow relative to $dX$. ``Some manifolds are intrinsically more concave than others with respect to any gradient flow'' is the main slogan of the talk. Stated differently, the intrinsic concavity of $X$ is a reflection of its complexity. We will explain how this approach leads to new topological invariants, both of the flow $v$ and of the manifold $X$. In 3D, we have a good grasp of these invariants and their connection to the classification of 3-folds.
