Budney recently constructed an operad that encodes splicing of knots and extends his little 2-cubes operad action on the space of (long) knots.  He further decomposed the space of knots as the space freely generated over the splicing operad by the subspace of torus and hyperbolic knots.  Infection of knots (or links) by string links is a generalization of splicing from knots to links and is useful for studying concordance of knots.  In joint work with John Burke, we have constructed a colored operad that encodes this infection operation.  This suggests looking for other ways to decomposes spaces of knots and links, which is a main direction of our work in progress.
