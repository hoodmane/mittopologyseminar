 Actions of finite groups on spheres can be studied in various different geometrical settings, such as (A) smooth $G$-actions on a (closed manifold) homotopy sphere, (B) finite $G$-homotopy representations (as defined by tom Dieck), and (C) finite $G$-CW complexes homotopy equivalent to a sphere. These three settings generalize the basic models arising from unit spheres $S(V)$ in orthogonal or unitary $G$-representations. In the talk, I will discuss the group theoretic constraints imposed by assuming that the actions have rank 1 isotropy (meaning that the isotropy subgroups of $G$ do not contain $\Z/p \times \Z/p$, for any prime $p$).  Motivation for this requirement arises from the work of Adem and Smith (2001) on the existence of free action on products of spheres.

The main results are as follows: we give a complete answer in setting (C), where we prove that a necessary and sufficient group theoretic condition is that certain extensions, called $QD(p)$, of $SL(2,p)$ by $\Z/p \times \Z/p$ are not involved in $G$. In setting (B) we encounter more group theoretic restrictions, and give a complete answer for the finite simple groups $G$ of rank 2. The arguments use chain complexes over the orbit category. This is joint work with Ergun Yalcin.
