Kiyoshi Igusa will speak on:
<h4>This talk is about the axiomatic approach to higher Franz-
Reidemeister (FR) torsion.
We consider smooth manifold bundles M\to E\to B satisfying certain
conditions (e.g., B simply connected is sufficient for all cases).
For these bundles there are several real characteristic classes \tau
(E)\in H^{4k}(B;R): higher FR torsion, analytic torsion classes,
higher Dwyer-Weiss-Williams (DWW) classes and tautological (Miller-
Morita-Mumford) classes.
However, for fixed k and fixed parity of the dimension of M there
is only one characteristic class (up to a scalar multiple) satisfying
two axioms.

Using this theorem, old theorems become clearer and there are some
new results.
So far, only the FR-torsion and tautological classes are known to
satisfy the axioms. So they are proportional (old result). Sebastian
Goette and I have some new results which imply equality with DWW
torsion in some cases. Finally, I will attempt to extend axiomatic
torsion to the equivariant case.
