Mark Behrens will speak on:
<h4>Cohomology Theories Associated to Shimura Varieties</h4>
Abstract: I will discuss some joint work (in progress) with Tyler Lawson.  I
will briefly motivate the talk by describing how to use modular forms
and the building for GL_2 to capture a piece of the second chromatic
layer of the homotopy groups of spheres.  I will then describe how a
similar construction (using the building for GL_n) may be considered
in connection with chromatic level n - where elliptic curves are
replaced with certain abelian varieties with complex multiplication.
