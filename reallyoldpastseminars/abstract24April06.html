John Hopkinson will speak on:
<h4>Universal polynomials in lambda rings and the K-theory of the infinite loop space tmf</h4>
Abstract: The algebraic structure of the K-theory of a topological space is described by the more general notion of a lambda ring. We show how computations in a lambda ring are facilitated by the use of Adams operations, which are ring homomorphisms, and apply this principle to understand the algebraic structure.

In a torsion free ring the Adams operations completely determine the lambda ring. This principle can be used to determine the K-theory of an infinite loop space functorially in terms of the K-theory of the corresponding spectrum. In particular we obtain a description of the K-theory of the infinite loop space tmf in terms of Katz's ring of divided congruences of modular forms. At primes greater than 3 we can also relate this to a Hecke algebra.
