Classification of 2-types

ABSTRACT
Here's a basic fact: The homotopy category of 1-types (i.e. connected spaces with only one non-trivial homotopy group in dimension 1) is equivalent to the category of groups. Namely, taking $\pi_1$, and the classifying space give inverse equivalences.

What about 2-types, i.e. if we allow $\pi_2$ to be non-trivial? Then the appropriate algebraic model is given by crossed modules. I will present this classic result that goes back to J.H.C. Whitehead, and explain why I care about it from a more modern point of view.

Time permitting, I will also say a few words about 3-types.

Gr&ouml;bner bases in rational homotopy theory

ABSTRACT
The Mayer-Vietoris sequence in cohomology has an obvious Eckmann-Hilton dual which
characterizes the homotopy of a pullback, but there is no dual to the Eilenberg-Moore
spectral sequence characterizing the homotopy of a pushout. The main obstacle is the
lack of an Eckmann-Hilton dual to the K&uuml;nneth theorem with which to understand the
homotopy of a coproduct.
This difficulty disappears when working rationally, and we dualize one particular
construction of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence to produce a spectral sequence
converging to the homotopy of a pushout. We use Gr&ouml;bner-Shirshov bases, an analogue
of Gr&ouml;bner bases for free Lie algebras, to compute the E^2 term for pushouts of wedges
of spheres. We are able to mostly avoid
the use of minimal models, and instead approach simple but open problems in rational
homotopy theory using the combinatorial properties of Gr&ouml;bner-Shirshov bases.

Derived algebraic geometry over E_n-rings

SPECIAL
Friday, 4pm. Location: 2-131.

ABSTRACT
 We develop a theory of <i>less</i> commutative algebraic geometry where the role of commutative rings
is assumed by E_n-rings, that is, rings with multiplication parametrized by configuration spaces of
points in R^n. As n increases, these theories converge to the derived algebraic geometry of To&euml;n-
Vezzosi and Lurie. The class of spaces obtained by gluing E_n-rings form a geometric counterpart to
E_n-categories, which are higher topological variants of braided monoidal categories. These spaces
further provide a geometric language for the deformation theory of general E_n structures. A version
of the cotangent complex governs such deformation theories, and we relate its values to E_n-Hochschild
cohomology. In the affine case, this establishes a claim made by Kontsevich. Other applications
include a geometric description of higher Drinfeld centers of E_n-categories, explored in work with
Ben-Zvi and Nadler.

Three-Dimensional Local Field Theory

SPECIAL
Tuesday, 4pm. Location: 2-146.

ABSTRACT
I will describe the classification of 3-dimensional local topological field theories: corresponding to each dualizable object of a symmetric monoidal 3-category C, there is a 3-d local TFT with target C.  The key technical ingredient is the classification of flag foliated singularities through dimension 4.  As an application, I will introduce a local field theory corresponding to the conformal net of local fermions.  This is joint work in progress with Arthur Bartels and Andre Henriques.  (Note: A 3-dimensional local TFT has values for 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-manifolds, and is sometimes called a 0+1+1+1-dimensional theory, or an extended theory.)

Grothendieck Derivators
ABSTRACT

Derivators were introduced by Grothendieck in pursuing stacks and studied (sometimes indepently, and/or under various forms) later by A. Heller, J. Franke, B. Keller. Derivators describe the structure of homotopy categories in terms of homotopy limits and colimits.  This talk will give an introduction to the subject. Illustrations will be given about the following fact: the derivator defined by classical homotopy theory of CW-complexes can be defined by an intrinsic universal property, giving rise to a nice theory of homotopy Kan extensions in derivators.  This is the corner stone to understand the link between derivators and higher homotopical structures.

K-theory and abstract homotopy theory
ABSTRACT

Algebraic K-theory of a ring encodes the "higher homotopy theory" of the
derived category.  I will discuss recent work with Mandell which makes this
slogan precise by giving an explicit description of the K-theory space of a
Waldhausen category in terms of the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization of the
category.  This allows us to prove a very general criterion for functors to
induce an equivalence of K-theory, and also has applications in the study of
the K-theory of nonconnective ring spectra.

Chain rules for Goodwillie calculus
ABSTRACT

I'll explain work (joint with Greg Arone) to understand chain rules for Goodwillie's homotopy calculus. In order to express these chain rules, we produce nice models for the derivatives of various functors that have extra algebraic structure. In particular, we get a deeper understanding of where the operad structure on the derivatives of the identity comes from. These models should work in a much wider context than functors of topological spaces, and if there's time and interest, I'll mention some applications of these ideas to the algebraic K-theory of A<sub>&infin;</sub> and E<sub>&infin;</sub> ring spectra.

The topology of moduli spaces of flat connections on Riemann surfaces (revisited)
ABSTRACT

Let G be a connected, semi-simple  compact Lie group.  In
this talk I will describe a stability theorem for the homology of the
moduli space, (M<sub>g</sub>)<sup>G</sup>,  of equivalence classes of triples (S, E,
&omega;),  where S is a closed  Riemann surface of genus g, E&rarr;S is
a principal G-bundle, and &omega; is a flat connection on E.  The
theorem states that in a stable range (approximately g/2), the
homology of this moduli space is isomorphic to the homology of an
explicit infinite loop space.  As a corollary, one has that in this
stable range, the rational cohomology of this moduli space is
generated by the  Mumford-Morita kappa classes and H<sup>*</sup>(BG).  When G
is the trivial group, this is a combination of the Mumford conjecture
as proved by Madsen and Weiss,  and   Harer's  stability theorem.   I
will also draw implications to moduli spaces of semi-stable
holomorphic bundles, and to representation varieties.   Finally I
will describe a related result, identifying the homotopy type of the
cobordism category of surfaces with flat G-connections.    This is
all joint work with S. Galatius and N. Kitchloo.

ABSTRACT

Classical obstruction theory seemingly produces uncountably many

Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence converging to the homotopy groups of

spectral sequence has infinitely many differentials, and to show that
all the relevant classes die we study the connective Morava K-theory
spectrum k(n) and use the theory of Postnikov towers and S-algebra
k-invariants developed by Dugger and Shipley.

The generating hypothesis in the stable module category of a group
ABSTRACT
Let G be a finite group and let k be a field whose characteristic
p divides the order of G. Freyd's generating hypothesis for the

finite-dimensional kG-modules in the thick subcategory generated by
k factors through a projective if the induced map on Tate cohomology
is trivial. I will give an overview of joint work with Sunil Chebolu and
J&aacute;n Min&aacute;&#269; in which we show that for groups with periodic
cohomology, the generating hypothesis holds if and only if the Sylow
p-subgroup of G is C<sub>2</sub> or C<sub>3</sub>.

as the generating hypothesis.

Derived Hall algebras for stable homotopy theories
ABSTRACT
The notion of a Hall algebra has been a useful tool in

relationship, Toen defines the derived Hall algebra associated to a
particular kind of stable model category.  We'd like to extend his work to
more general stable homotopy theories, using the complete Segal space
model for homotopy theories.  This talk will include background on Hall
algebras, a summary of Toen's work, and recent progress on extending to
this more general situation.
