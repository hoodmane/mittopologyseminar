Bertrand Toen will speak on:
<h4>The homotopy theory of dg-categories and its applications</h4>
G. Tubuada proved recently that the category of dg-categories is endowed with a model structure for which the weak equivalences are the quasi-equivalences. In this talk I will explain how the mapping spaces of this model structure can be explicitly computed, and I will deduce from this an extension of Morita theory to dg-algebras.
