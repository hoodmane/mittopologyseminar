Gunnar Carlsson will speak on:
<h4>Topology of point cloud data with examples</h4>
Abstract: Algebraic topology has for the most part been used in situations 
where by-hand computation of topological invariants is feasible, and 
where one has complete information about the space in question.  The 
goal of this talk is to discuss the ideas behind current efforts to 
compute homological invariants of spaces automatically, when one is 
only given a large but finite set of points sampled from the space, 
perhaps with noise.  I will discuss the theory and techniques which 
are used, and also describe some situations where such computations 
are important for some "real world" problems.
