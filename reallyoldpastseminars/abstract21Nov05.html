Kevin Costello will speak on:
<h4>This talk is about the relation between the moduli spaces of 
Riemann surfaces, Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras and linear symplectic 
geometry.  I'll show how inside the uncompactified moduli spaces of 
Riemann surfaces one can find, in a canonical way up to homotopy, a 
chain playing the role of the fundamental class of the Deligne-Mumford 
spaces.  This is not closed, but satisfies a certain BV master equation, 
for a BV algebra structure introduced by Sen and Zwiebach.  This 
construction allows us to construct the analog of the Gromov-Witten 
potential associated to a TCFT.  This is a state in a certain Fock 
space.
