a smooth manifold M and two submanifolds A and B, their intersection
need not be a smooth manifold. By Thom's transversality theorem, one
can deform A to be transverse to B and take the intersection: the
result, written A<img src="MIT%20Topology%20Seminar_files/pitchfork.gif" style="width: 1em; height: 1em;" alt="pitchfork">B,
will be a smooth manifold. Moreover, if A and B are compact, then there
is a cup product formula in cobordism, integral cohomology, etc. of the
form [A]∪[B]=[A<img src="MIT%20Topology%20Seminar_files/pitchfork.gif" style="width: 1em; height: 1em;" alt="pitchfork">B], where [-] denotes the cohomology fundamental class.<br><br>

The problem is that A<img src="MIT%20Topology%20Seminar_files/pitchfork.gif" style="width: 1em; height: 1em;" alt="pitchfork">B
is not unique, and there is no functorial way to choose transverse
intersections for pairs of submanifolds. The goal of the theory of
derived manifolds is to correct this defect.<br><br>


The category of derived manifolds contains the category of manifolds as a
full subcategory, is closed under taking intersections of manifolds, and yet
has enough structure that every compact derived manifold has a fundamental
class. Even if the submanifolds A and B of M are not transverse (in which
case their intersection can be arbitrarily singular), their intersection
Ax<sub>M</sub>B will be a derived manifold with [Ax<sub>M</sub>B]=
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">[A<img src="MIT%20Topology%20Seminar_files/pitchfork.gif" style="width: 1em; height: 1em;" alt="pitchfork">B]</span>, and thus satisfy the above cup
product formula.<br><br>

To construct the category of derived manifolds, one imitates the constructions
of schemes, but in a smooth and homotopical way. I will begin the talk by
explaining this construction. Then I will give some examples and discuss some
features of the category of derived manifolds. I will end by sketching the
Thom-Pontrjagin argument which implies that compact derived manifolds have
fundamental classes.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">04.27.09: <span class="speaker">Stefan Hornet</span> (<a class="institution" href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>). <span class="title">A generalization of a theorem of Ravenel and Wilson</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract"></span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">04.20.09: <a class="reason" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots_Day">Patriots Day</a>.</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">04.15.09: <a class="speaker" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cohf/">Fred Cohen</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>). <span class="title">Generalized moment-angle complexes</span>.</div><div class="tail"><strong><span class="special">This will be a Wednesday talk, at 4:00 in 2-143.</span></strong><span class="abstract">A
second subspace of a product is the generalized moment-angle complex
first defined in generality by Neil Strickland. Definitions, examples,
as well as connections will be addressed.<br><br>
One notable case is given by subspaces of products of infinite
dimensional complex projective space 'indexed by a finite simplicial
complex'. These spaces appearing in work of Goresky-MacPherson,
Davis-Januskiewicz, Buchstaber-Panov-Ray, Denham-Suciu, Franz as well
as many others encode information ranging from the structure of toric
varieties in one guise, Stanley-Reisner rings, as well as 'motions of
certain types of robotic legs' in another guise.<br><br>

What do these spaces have to do with the motions of legs of a cockroach?  This feature will be illustrated with slides.<br><br>
Features of these spaces are developed within the context of classical
homotopy theory based on joint work with A. Bahri, M. Bendersky, and S.
Gitler.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">04.14.09: <a class="speaker" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cohf/">Fred Cohen</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>). <span class="title">On natural subspaces of products, and their applications</span>.</div><div class="tail"><strong><span class="special">This will be a Tuesday talk, at 4:00 in 2-151.</span></strong><span class="abstract">The
first basic example here is the configuration space of unordered

of M given by the complex numbers, these spaces can be identified as
the space of classical complex, monic polynomials of degree k which
have exactly k distinct roots.<br><br>
Elementary features of these spaces as well as their connections to
spaces of knots, links, and homotopy groups of spheres will be
addressed. These topics are based on joint work with R. Budney as well

subject of this talk is the structure of the space of homomorphisms
from a free abelian group to a Lie group G as well as quotients spaces
given by the associated space of representations. These spaces as well
as further spaces of representations admit the structure of a
simplicial space at the heart of the work here. Features of geometric
realizations will be developed.<br><br>

What is the fundamental group or the first homology group of the associated space in case G is a finite, discrete group?<br><br>
This deceptively elementary question as well as more global information
given in this talk is based on joint work with A. Adem, E. Torres, and

will describe the stable (in genus) structure of the universal moduli
space of flat connections on riemann surfaces. I will also introduce
the category of 1-manifolds and 2-cobordisms endowed with flat
connections. Using classical techniques of Atiyah-Bott, and more recent
techniques introduced by Madsen-Weiss and coauthors, we will give a
complete description of the classifying space of this category. This is
joint work with R. Cohen and S. Galatius.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.30.09: <span class="speaker">Sam Isaacson</span> (<a class="institution" href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard Univeristy</a>). <span class="title">Cubical homotopy theory and monoidal model categories</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract">Let
C be a model category. In a 2001 paper, Dan Dugger showed that if C is
combinatorial, it can be realized as a left Bousfield
localization of simplicial presheaves on some small site. I'll
describe a variation of this theorem: by replacing simplicial sets
with a cubical model for the homotopy category, we can produce a
presentation for C when C is symmetric monoidal that retains the
monoidal structure of C as the Day convolution product.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.23.09: <a class="reason" href="http://web.mit.edu/registrar/calendar/">MIT Spring break</a>.</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.16.09: <a class="speaker" href="http://mypage.iu.edu/%7Emmandell/">Mike Mandell</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.math.indiana.edu/">Indiana Univeristy</a>). <span class="title">Localization in THH and TC</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract"></span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.09.09: <a class="speaker" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/u/faculty/doug/">Douglas Ravenel</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>). <span class="title">Homotopy fixed point spectra for finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract"></span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.03.09: <span class="speaker">Pascal Lambrechts</span> (<a class="institution" href="http://wis.kuleuven.be/?lang=eng">University of Louvain</a>). <span class="title">Rational homology of spaces of smooth embeddings</span>.</div><div class="tail"><strong><span class="special">This will be a Tuesday talk, at 4:00 in 2-151.</span></strong><span class="abstract">For a given compact smooth manifold M we consider the space
Emb(M,R<sup>k</sup>) of smooth embeddings of M into some large Euclidean space
R<sup>k</sup>, or rather some geometric variant of it, which is a homotopy
invariant of M.<br><br>
I will explain how Goodwillie's cutting method enables us
to understand the homotopy type of this space of emeddings.
I will then prove that the rational homology of that space is actually
an invariant of the rational homotopy type of M. The proof is based
on Kontsevich's theorem on the formality of the little cube operad
and Arone's description of the layers of Weiss' orthogonal tower for
the space of embeddings.
This is a joint work with Greg Arone and Ismar Volic.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.02.09: <span class="speaker">John Harper</span> (<a class="institution" href="http://sma.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>). <span class="title">Bar constructions and Quillen homology of modules over operads</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract">In Haynes Miller's proof of the Sullivan conjecture on maps from classifying
spaces, Quillen's derived functor notion of homology (in the case of
commutative algebras) is a critical ingredient. This suggests that homology
for the larger class of algebraic structures parametrized by an operad will
also provide interesting and useful invariants. Working in the two contexts
of symmetric spectra and unbounded chain complexes, we establish a homotopy
theory for studying Quillen homology of modules and algebras over operads,
and we show that this homology can be calculated using simplicial bar
constructions. A key part of the argument is proving that the forgetful
functor commutes with certain homotopy colimits. A larger goal is to
determine the extra structure that appears on the derived homology and the
extent to which the original object can be recovered from its homology when
this extra structure is taken into account. This talk is an introduction to
these results with an emphasis on several of the motivating ideas.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">02.23.09: <span class="speaker">Samik Basu</span> (<a class="institution" href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>). <span class="title">A<sub>∞</sub> structures on Thom spectra</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract">Let R be an E<sub>∞</sub> ring spectrum. Given a map f:X -&gt; BGL<sub>1</sub>(R),
we can construct a Thom spectrum X<sup>f</sup>. If f is a loop map, then there is an
A<sub>∞</sub> R module structure on the Thom spectrum. I will consider various
examples of these Thom spectra and construct A<sub>∞</sub> structures on them. I
will then use this identification to calculate Topological Hochschild
Homology.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">02.16.09: <a class="reason" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_day">Presidents Day</a>.</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">02.09.09: <a class="speaker" href="http://palmer.wellesley.edu/%7Emunson/">Brian Munson</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.wellesley.edu/Math/index.html">Wellesley College</a>). <span class="title">A stable range description of the space of link maps</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract">For
smooth manifolds P, Q, and N, let Link(P,Q;N) denote the space of
smooth maps of P in N and Q in N such that their images are disjoint. I
will discuss the connectivity of a "generalized linking number" from
the homotopy fiber of the inclusion of Link(P,Q;N) into
Map(P,N)xMap(Q,N) to a certain cobordism space of manifolds over a
space which is a homotopy theoretic model for the intersections of P
and Q. The proof of the connectivity uses some easy statements about
connectivities in the world of smooth manifolds as a guide for
obtaining similar estimates in a setting where the tools of
differential topolgy do not apply. This is joint work with Tom
Goodwillie.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">12.15.08: <a class="speaker" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Ebotvinn/">Boris Botvinnik</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.math.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>). <span class="title">Cobordism category of manifolds with positive scalar curvature</span>.</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">12.09.08: <a class="speaker" href="http://math.depaul.edu/%7Ekragnars/">Kari Ragnarsson</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://math.depaul.edu/">DePaul University</a>). <span class="title">Fusion in the Burnside ring</span>.</div><div class="tail"><strong><span class="special">This talk is to be held at 4pm in room 2-151.</span></strong><span class="abstract">In
this talk I will present recent work, joint with Radu Stancu, in which
we obtain a bijection between saturated fusion systems on a finite
p-group S and idempotents in the double Burnside ring of S satisfying a
"Frobenius reciprocity relation". (These terms will all be defined in
the talk.) The theorem and its proof are purely algebraic, so I will
focus attention on implications in algebraic topology, answering
long-standing questions on the stable splitting of classifying space
and generalizing a variant of the Adams-Wilderson theorem, as well as
the obvious implications for p-local finite groups.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">12.08.08: <a class="speaker" href="http://www.hausdorff-research-institute.uni-bonn.de/kreck">Matthias Kreck</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/">Universität Bonn</a>). <span class="title">Codes, arithmetic and 3-manifolds</span>.</div><div class="tail"><strong><span class="special">This talk will begin at 5:00.

Umkehr map g_! from the fg-twisted R-theory of Y to the f-twisted R-
