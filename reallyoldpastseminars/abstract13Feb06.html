Eric Rains will speak on:
<h4>The cohomology ring of the real locus of ${\bar M}_{0,n}$</h4>
Abstract: The moduli space $M_{0,n}$ (the set of equivalence classes of
n-tuples of distinct points on the projective line under simultaneous
 linear fractional transformations) has a natural compactification to a
 smooth projective shceme ${\bar M}_{0,n}$.  Since this scheme is defined
 over $\Z$, its real locus is a smooth (in general nonorientable)
 manifold.  The rational cohomology algebra of this manifold has a number
 of interesting properties, most notably the fact that its Poincar\'e
 polynomial factors completely (in sharp contrast to the corresponding
 complex manifold).  I'll discuss recent work with Etingof, Henriques,
 and Kamnitzer deriving this Poincar\'e polynomial, as well as an
 explicit presentation and basis of the cohomology algebra.
