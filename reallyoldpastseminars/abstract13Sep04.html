Mark Behrens will speak on:
<h4>A modular description of the K(2)-local sphere</h4>
I will describe how to understand the second layer of the chromatic
filtration on the (3-primary) stable homotopy groups of spheres in terms of
elliptic curves and isogenies.  Specifically, I will describe a spectrum Q
which is built out of spectra related to tmf using isogenies of elliptic
curves.  I will then describe how the K(2)-local sphere may be built out of
Q and its Spanier-Whitehead dual, DQ.
