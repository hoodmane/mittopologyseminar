stability if the i-th homology group is independent of n for

that isolates the conditions on the groups from the condition
on the complexes. In particular, I explain why stability is
slower for the alternating groups than the symmetric groups,

In this talk we will discuss two theorems which resemble the
classical cohomological and homological Brown
representability theorems. The main difference is that our
results classify small contravariant functors from spaces to
spaces up to weak equivalence of functors.<br /><br />

In more detail, we will show that every small contravariant
functor from spaces to spaces converting coproducts to
products, up to homotopy, and taking homotopy pushouts to
homotopy pullbacks is naturally weekly equivalent to a
representable functor. This theorem may be considered as a
contravariant analog of Goodwillie's classification of linear
functors, see his [Calculus II, III] papers. The
interpretation of the current result in terms of Homotopy
Calculus is still a challenge.<br /><br />

Homological representability theorem states: every
contravariant continuous functor from the category of finite
simplicial sets to simplicial sets is equivalent to a
restriction of a representable functor. This theorem is
essentially equivalent to Goodwillie's classification of
linear functors.

computing the topological Hochschild homology of the

show how some of these computations are simplified by modern
machinery.  I will then indicate&mdash;without actually doing

Quasi-categories were introduced by Boardman and Vogt, then
more recently named and developed by Joyal, Lurie, and
others.  The model theory of quasi-categories can be thought
of as a model of the homotopy theory of homotopy theories,
alongside e.g. complete Segal spaces and simplicially
enriched categories.  Quasi-categories have the advantage,
however, of functioning theoretically much like ordinary
categories, as well as being functionally extremely simple
(they are just simplicial sets satisfying the inner
horn-filling condition).<br /><br />

It is the goal of this talk to discuss one such similarity,
namely the notion of quasi-category fibred in Kan complexes
(what one might call quasi-category fibred in
quasi-groupoids, and what in practice is known as a right
fibration).  Not only do these objects generalize
Grothendieck's categories fibred in groupoids, the
quasi-category of right fibrations over a given base
simplicial set S can be constructed as having n-simplices
being all right fibrations over S&times;&Delta;<sup>n</sup>.
Thus, the quasi-cateogry of right fibrations can be thought
of as a quasi-cateogry which arises &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;
(as opposed to as the coherent nerve of a category enriched
in Kan complexes, for example).  Constructing the
quasi-category this way also means this quasi-category
classifies families of right fibrations up to
<em>isomorphism</em> (not just homotopy equivalence).<br
/><br />

If there is time, we will also discuss how (homotopy) limits
and the Yoneda functor can be constructed directly using this
formalism.

on a manifold, which induces a spin structure on the free
loop space.  Using a Hodge theoretic version of the Serre

often very difficult, understanding fixed point spectra of
topological Hochschild homology can aid in such
computations.Taking homotopy groups of these spectra, we
arrive at TR-groups, an integer-graded theory with a rigid
algebraic structure. By understanding TR-groups, one can
compute topological cyclic homology, and consequently,
algebraic K-theory.  This homotopy theoretic approach to
algebraic K-theory has been very fruitful.<br /><br />

For many algebraic K-theory computations, however, it is
beneficial to further exploit the S<sup>1</sup>-equivariant
structure of topological Hochschild homology. The topological
Hochschild S<sup>1</sup>-spectrum has naturally associated
equivariant homotopy groups graded by the real representation
ring of S<sup>1</sup>, which provide an
RO(S<sup>1</sup>)-graded TR-theory.<br /><br />

In this talk we will review classical TR-theory, and
introduce the RO(S<sup>1</sup>)-graded analog and its
applications to algebraic K-theory. The main result will be
the explicit computation of the RO(S<sup>1</sup>)-graded
equivariant homotopy of THH(F<sub>p</sub>). This computation
of TR<sup>n</sup><sub>&alpha;</sub>(F<sub>p</sub>;p) extends
a result of Hesselholt and Madsen to provide the first
complete computation of RO(S<sup>1</sup>)-graded
TR-groups. In particular, we compute the groups
TR<sup>n</sup><sub>q+&alpha;</sub>(F<sub>p</sub>;p) for q
even, and the order of these groups for q odd.</span></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.26.07: <a class="reason" href="http://web.mit.edu/registrar/www/calendar.html">Spring break</a>.</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="head">03.19.07: <a class="speaker" href="http://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~nan25776/">Niko Naumann</a> (<a class="institution" href="http://www.mathematik.uni-regensburg.de/Math-Net/index.en.html">Regensburg</a>). <span class="title">K(1)-local tmf</span>.</div><div class="tail"><span class="abstract"> We review the contruction of M.

well-known local-to-global questions in group theory, such as
the classification of finite simple groups. The approach goes
via the theory of p-local finite groups. This talk is a

the conjecture that there are no non-trivial maps between finite
spectra which are zero on all stable homotopy groups. Despite serious
efforts of homotopy theorists over the last 40 years the conjecture
remains open; only partial affirmative results are known due to
Devinatz. In order to gain some insight into this deep problem it is
natural to investigate its analogues in some algebraic
settings.<br /><br />

In this talk, I will formulate the analogue of the GH in the stable
module category of a finite p-group. I will show that the only
p-groups for which this version of the GH holds are the cyclic group
of order 2 and 3.  For the other groups, I will introduce an integer
invariant which measures the degree of the failure of the GH, and will
show to compute this invariant in some examples.<br /><br />

Nov. 29 in 4-257.</span></strong><span class="abstract">I will start with a short introduction to
Norton's generalized Moonshine conjecture and lay out how the geometry
of equivariant elliptic cohomology naturally gives rise to
Moonshine-like objects and to the Moonshine notion of "twisted Hecke
operators".  This discussion results in a formula describing the
effect of Hecke operators on Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel characters.<br /><br />

Here I switch subjects and outline how, in the light of my thesis, the
work of Dijkgraaf, Moore, Verlinde and Verlinde dictates a definition
of power operations in Devoto's equivariant Tate K-theory (making the
Witten genus an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> map) and how the work of Lupercio,
Uribe and Xicotencatl provides a motivation for these definitions in
terms of the theory of orbifold loop spaces.<br /><br />

The resulting Hecke operators are described by the same formula as the
twisted Hecke operators in generalized Moonshine. Further, they agree
with Matthew Ando's definition of Hecke operators on K<sub>Tate</sub>,
making our power operations 'elliptic' in the sense of [Ando, Hopkins,
Strickland II] and putting the fact that the Witten genus is an
H<sub>&#8734;</sub> map into the same framework as the
Ando-Hopkins-Strickland result that the sigma-orientation of

complexes in an abelian category by passing to chain homotopy classes
or inverting quasi-isomorphisms. Such examples are called
&#8216;algebraic&#8217; because they have underlying abelian (or at
least additive) categories.  Stable homotopy theory produces examples
of triangulated categories by quite different means, and in this
context the underlying categories are usually very
&#8216;non-additive&#8217; before passing to homotopy classes of
morphisms. Because of their origin I refer to these examples as
&#8216;topological triangulated categories&#8217; (not to be confused
with topologically enriched categories).<br /><br />

In this talk I want to explain some systematic differences between
these two kinds of triangulated categories. There are certain
properties&mdash;defined entirely in terms of the triangulated
structure&mdash;which hold in all algebraic examples, but typically
fail in topological examples. These differences are all torsion
phenomena, and rationally there is no difference between algebraic and

sets, to be called that of "dendroidal" sets. I will explain how some
notions for simplicial sets extend to the dendroidal context, and in
particular explain the comparison of ratios categories: <em>simplicial
sets = operads : dendroidal sets</em>.</span></div></div>
