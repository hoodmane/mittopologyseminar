Tim Cochran will speak on:
<h4>Knots, Gropes and von Neumann &rho;-invariants</h4>
Abstract: I will give a leisurely talk will be about how some very topological questions
can be approached with the help of noncommutative algebra and functional
analysis. We address the classical question: When does a knotted circle in the
3-sphere bound an embedded 2-dimensional disk in the 4-ball?  We "filter" this
question by asking when such a knot is the boundary of a "Grope" of height n.
Gropes are 2-complexes that are constructed inductively from surfaces glued
together. (In 3-dimensions, this filtration is related to the Kontsevitch
integral !). After reviewing a little history of this problem, we will
indicate how noncommutative algebra and von Neumann algebras arise naturally
through the study of equivariant homology groups and equivariant intersection
forms, and how these give new information about this classical problem.  The
work described is primarily joint with Peter Teichner (also Kent Orr and
Taehee Kim).
