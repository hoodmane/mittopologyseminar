Bob Bruner will speak on:
<h4>Homotopy fixed points of equivariant S-algebras</h4>
Abstract: In joint work with John Rognes,  we analyze the
   homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for the homology of
   an S^1-equivariant S-algebra.  As a consequence we get
   good collapse results for spectral sequences involved in
   the calculation of the topological cyclic homology of
   many MU-spectra.
