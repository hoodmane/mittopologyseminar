Jacob Lurie will speak on:
<h4>Elliptic Cohomology and Derived Algebraic Geometry</h4>
Abstract: I will begin by reviewing the classical point of view on elliptic cohomology, leading up to the construction (due to Hopkins and Miller) of the spectrum tmf of "topological modular forms". I will then introduce the language of derived algebraic geometry, and explain how it can be applied to give a new (and easier) construction of tmf, together with a moduli-theoretic interpretation of this theory in terms of "derived elliptic curves".
